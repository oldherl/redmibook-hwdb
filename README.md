# redmibook-hwdb
hwdb rules for running Linux on my Xiaomi [RedmiBook Pro 15 2022 Ryzen edition](https://www.mi.com/redmibook/pro15-amd/specs) laptop.

## What does it fix?
* Wrong or inconvenient key codes generated by the internal keyboard of the laptop. Currently it includes:
  * Enter key should not be KP_Enter (that's for the numeric keypad)
  * Remap the useless XiaoAi key to Insert key, which is present but only as cubersome Fn+F12 if Fn Lock is on.
  * Remap the Fn-locked right Ctrl as just Ctrl, not Menu. Most Linux users would turn on the Fn Lock permanently, so a right Ctrl is more useful than a Menu key.

## What does it not fix?
* If your keyboard doesn't work at all in Linux, that's because your kernel is too old (<6.0) and missing a
[patch](https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220712020058.90374-1-gch981213@gmail.com/) to make it work.
Either apply the patch and rebuild the kernel, or to use a newer (>=6.0) kernel.
* Media keys. You need to use redmibook-wmi for that.
* On Windows. Go to your support representative and pray for a human to understand your problem.

## How to use
### Arch Linux
Install the AUR package [redmibook-hwdb-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/redmibook-hwdb-git).
### Other
The basic idea is to put the `*.hwdb` file somewhere like `/usr/lib/udev/hwdb.d/`, and run `/usr/bin/systemd-hwdb --usr update` command to update the database.
